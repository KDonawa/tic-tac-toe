## Features

-   Unbeatable tic-tac-toe AI made with using a recursive minimax algorithm in addition to common game opening strategies
-   Player 1 plays as X and Player 2 as O
-   The starting player is randomized to ensure fairness

## Future Improvements

-   Add a start screen to allow players to select AI difficulties or play against another human
-   Different colors for the X's and O's to make patterns more visible
-   Game won effect to highlight the winning pattern (green if player won, red if AI won)
-   Waiting effect to allow the AI appear to be thinking
-   Screen effect to highlight current player during their turn
